**Ingredients**
- 1 cup unsalted butter
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- ⅓ cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs at room temp
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4 oz toffee bits 
- 1 3.5 oz bar of dark chocolate

**Method**
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit. 
2. Brown your butter
    - Cook the butter in a medium, light-bottomed pot on medium heat stirring constantly. The butter will foam and then brown. 
    - Once the butter has reached a golden-brown color, immediately transfer it to a heat-proof bowl. 
    - Place the butter in the fridge as you complete the next steps. Remove the butter from the fridge if it begins to solidify.
3. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, and kosher salt in a small bowl. 
4. Combine your wet ingredients.
    - Add the brown sugar, granulated sugar, and browned butter in the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat for about 1 minute on medium speed until well combined.
    - Add eggs and vanilla to the mixing bowl. Beat for about 1 minute or until the mixture lightens and begins to thicken.
5. Combine the dry ingredients with the wet.
    - Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredient mixture. Beat until just combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. 
    - Roughly and unevenly chop the chocolate bar. Add the chocolate pieces and toffee bits to the cookie dough and mix on low until combined. 
6. Let dough sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to ensure the flour hydrates.
7. On a parchment-lined baking sheet, place golf ball sized portions of dough about 3” apart. 
8. Bake cookies until the edges are golden brown and firm but the centers are still soft, about 9-11 minutes. 
9. Let the cookies cool on a wire rack.
