**Ingredients**
- Leftover pizza
- 3 large eggs
- ¼-½ cup of whole milk
- Spices to taste
- Salt

- Cayenne
- Paprika
- Oregano
- 1-2 tbsp olive oil

**Method**
- In a medium sized, flat-bottom dish, whisk together your eggs, milks, and spices.
- Dunk each slice of pizza into your custard on both sides. Let each slice soak for about 30 seconds before removing them from the custard. 
- Heat a pan over medium with enough olive oil to coat the bottom. 
- Once the pan and oil are preheated, place each soaked slice of pizza crust-side down in the pan.
- Fry for 3-5 minutes until the crust is dark brown.
- Flip each slice and fry the cheese side for an additional 3-5 minutes until the cheese is dark brown. 
- Remove each slice from the pan, serve, and feel that hangover melt away.
